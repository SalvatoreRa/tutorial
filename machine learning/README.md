This section is dedicated to tutorials about linear algebra (principle of mathematics for machine learning), machine learning algorithms (clustering, linear regression, classification, and so on), data science basics (data frame, data visualization, etc...), and principles of graph theory.

In this section, you will find the **Jupiter Notebook** for the tutorial I published in **Medium**. I suggest reading the tutorial and the companion tutorial code in the order provided in the table below. For practical reasons, I have divided some of the tutorials into more than one part (allowing me to concentrate in one of the tutorials on the theoretical part and the others on the programming). Tutorial dedicated only to the theory have not a linked Jupiter notebook containing the **Python** code used for the model and the graph. I wrote and test the code in Google Colab in order to make it reproducible.

I am progressively adding also some **R tutorials**, I decided to upload the R-scripts so you can test them. Check the table below where I list the Colab Notebooks, the R-scripts, and the companion articles.

Moreover, you may find here some Colab notebooks without a theoretical tutorial (yet). I decided to upload the code before I have finish to write the theoretical part (this would be indicated). I am convinced that the code alone is already beneficial. I would successively publish on Medium the written article (with details and comments on the code).

You can open a Github Issue for any request, comment or any issue you encounter.

# Utility

I am providing some useful functions and classes that can be ready to use. I am providing them as executable Python files that you can import and use. You find them in the **utility folder**.

Check in the utiliy folder the example of usages and the explanation about them. Each function is a document and you can access the provided documentation.

For example, if you want to use my regression_report function in Colab you can import it in this way:

```Python
import sys
import os

user = "SalvatoreRa"
repo = "tutorial"
src_dir = "machine%20learning/utility/"
pyfile = "regression_report.py" #here the name of the file py

url = f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{user}/{repo}/main/{src_dir}/{pyfile}"
!wget --no-cache --backups=1 {url}
#copy here the link of the file
py_file_location = "https://github.com/SalvatoreRa/tutorial/blob/main/machine%20learning/utility/regression_report.py"
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(py_file_location))
#here the importing
from regression_report import regression_report 
```

Or alternatively, you can use in this way in Colab:

```Python
wget.download('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SalvatoreRa/tutorial/main/machine learning/utility/utils_NA.py')
!pip install wget 
from utils import *
import torch
import seaborn as sns

#generate different type of NA
X_miss_mcar = produce_NA(df, p_miss=0.4, mecha="MCAR")
X_miss_mar = produce_NA(df, p_miss=0.4, mecha="MAR", p_obs=0.5)
X_miss_mnar = produce_NA(df, p_miss=0.4, mecha="MNAR", opt="logistic", p_obs=0.5)
X_miss_quant = produce_NA(df, p_miss=0.4, mecha="MNAR", opt="quantile", p_obs=0.5, q=0.3)

```

# Scripts

Here you can find a list of scripts that have been used to generate images for the tutorials or that can be used to analyze data and models. You can easily adapt to your needs.

For example, if you want to use my MAR script in your pc you can simply execute it in this way:

```Python
python3 MAR.py
```

Or alternatively:

```Python
python3.8 MAR.py
```


| File |  Description |
|----------- | ------ |
|[MAR](https://github.com/SalvatoreRa/tutorial/blob/main/machine%20learning/scripts/MAR.py)| Loop to test different algorithms for MAR missing value imputation. The script is generating missing values, testing different imputation methods, and generating the plots |
|[MNAR](https://github.com/SalvatoreRa/tutorial/blob/main/machine%20learning/scripts/MNAR.py)| Loop to test different algorithms for MNAR missing value imputation. The script is generating missing values, testing different imputation methods, and generating the plots |
|[MCAR](https://github.com/SalvatoreRa/tutorial/blob/main/machine%20learning/scripts/MCAR.py)| Loop to test different algorithms for MCAR missing value imputation. The script is generating missing values, testing different imputation methods, and generating the plots |
